       On this tab you can find updates on the game development process. From early sketches and prototypes to finalized assets. I will try to update this page regularly as the project goes on so you can have a good sense of what was the thought process behind the final product.

            <dt>Controller and Early Physics:</dt>
                <dd>The physics of the game are designed to accommodate and include main game mechanics and features. As the player you are tasked to traverse around a planet and place protective shields that stop approaching meteors in their tracks. The movement is designed to be intuitive yet exciting with simulated gravity towards the centre of a 2D Planet.  </dd>

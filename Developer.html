        <h2>About the Developer</h2>    
        
        <p>
        
        I am a young developer currently attending my first year of an HND course at Fife College in video game development. My background is in Photography/Photogrammetry and Animation/VFX. My interests in video game development grew with the more I learned about general 3D development and design.</p> 
        <p>I have always loved playing and tinkering with video games. PC games have been a major part of my life since I was a kid. I have always felt lucky to be born in an era where computers exist. Getting engaged in game development has been a major influence on my interests and so the learning began. While there is still a long path ahead of me, overcoming each challenge brings me closer to my goal of working in the video game industry full time.</p>

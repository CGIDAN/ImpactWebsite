                <p>In the world of <strong>Impact</strong>, you are
                challenged to save the planet from a cometary extinction event.
                As the player.
                you assume control over our chief scientist. You are tasked to deploy as many
                <em>protective shields</em>
                around the planet as you can before time runs out to save
                our planet. </p>

            <h2>The Planet Is Our Home</h2>
            <p>Protecting it is our responsibility, whether it is about sustainability...

            or as
            in this case, total instantaneous extinction by meteors.
            <br />
            <br />
    
            While this scenario is very, very
            unlikely to happen in real life the possibility is still there, and this
            simulator could<br /> help you prepare for such disasters.
            While also having fun with
            it.
            <br />

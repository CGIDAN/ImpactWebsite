            In the world of <strong>Impact</strong>, you are
            challenged to save the planet from a cometary extinction event.
        <p>
            As the player.
            you assume control over our chief scientist. You are tasked to deploy as many
            <em>protective shields</em><br />
            around the planet as you can before time runs out to save
            our planet. </p>

                                  line-height:50%'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;

            This planet is our home and
            protecting it is our responsibility, whether it is about sustainability...<br />
            or as
            in this case, total instantaneous extinction by meteors. </p>
            <br />



        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;
                                  margin-left:-.25pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>
            While this scenario is very, very
            unlikely to happen in real life the possibility is still there, and this
            simulator could<br /> help you prepare for such disasters.
            While also having fun with
            it.
            I hope.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
